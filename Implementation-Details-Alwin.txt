Please find the below implementation details

Web API
 - Cleaned up the code 
 - Used AutoMapper for mapping of the data to DTO
 - Used Dependency Injection Resolver package (StructureMap)
 - Used Json.Net for converting the default response behavior from XML to JSON 
 - Used EnableCORS for allowing Same origin resource sharing request as WEB API consumed by MVC app

  (Note: I used .NET reflector tool to check the source code of the MortgageData.dll)

DTO
 - Added new fields

Unit Test
 - As already delayed submitting the proejct code hence didn't wrote it.

Web MVC
 - When the page loads it will call API Get method to get the mortgage types and displays it
 - User can hover over the list and select the row
 - User can enter the loan amount and loan duration in months
 - User will post the loan requested details to the API as POST which in turn calculates the total repayment of the loan and total interest.

 (Note: 
	Both Fixed and Variable interest has been handled in the same way
	jQuery is used as a scripting library
        ajax call are called for both GET And POST method call)



Deployment Details
------------------
1. Build the entire solution
2. Deploy the web api in the IIS with port number 81
3. Deploy the MVC app in the IIS with port number 52187

(Note: In case port number are being changed. Please make sure to update the port number in the MortgageCalculator of Web API and script section of Index.cshtml)
